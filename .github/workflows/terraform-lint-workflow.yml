# How it works:

#   1.	Triggering Events: The workflow triggers on pull requests and pushes to the main branch.
#   2.	Checkout Code: The repositoryâ€™s code is checked out.
#   3.	Set up Terraform: Terraform is installed and set up using the specified version.
#   4.	Install tflint: The tflint tool, which lints Terraform files, is installed.
#   5.	Run tflint: The workflow runs tflint to check the Terraform files for linting issues.
#   6.	Fail the Workflow: If any linting issues are found, the workflow will fail the pull request or merge to the main branch by running the exit 1 command.
