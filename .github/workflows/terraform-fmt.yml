        # How it works:
        #   1.	Triggering Events: The workflow triggers on both pull requests and pushes to the main branch.
        #   2.	Checkout Code: The repository is checked out.
        #   3.	Set up Terraform: Terraform is installed and set up.
        #   4.	Check Formatting: The terraform fmt -check -recursive command checks for formatting issues. If issues are found, it lists the files and fails the job. The terraform fmt -diff -recursive command shows the differences and outputs the files that need formatting.
        #   5.	Fail the Job on Pushes to Main: The workflow will fail on both pull requests and direct pushes to the main branch if formatting issues are detected, preventing the merge or push.
